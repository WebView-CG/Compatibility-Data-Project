## Android WebView

Android WebView is a library provided by the Android operating system. The API itself is a stable surface but Android
WebView is backed by an updatable library. Android WebView is Chromium based and so it mostly follows the same release
cycle as Chromium. The schedule for Android WebView releases can be found
[here](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule).

Like Chromium, Android WebView has different release channels that users can opt into for testing purposes. You can find
out more [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/android_webview/docs/prerelease.md).

## TODO: Any others?
