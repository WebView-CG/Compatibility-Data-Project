title: "Localhost"
description: "A lot of apps are built using hybrid app development frameworks that use one big WebView for providing app developers a native wrapper and some plugins for their Web app. The web content is often bundled and served within the native app. For a couple of reasons using the `file:` protocol to access web content is no longer an option and WebViews provide APIs to host content.

See more in [usage and challenges](https://webview-cg.github.io/usage-and-challenges/#the-origin-in-a-webview-for-locally-hosted-content)."
