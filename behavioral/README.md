## Project Timeline

### Stage 1: Initial data collection

**Goal date:** July 2024

The first stage will be focused on identifying behaviors and capturing unstructured data on the differences per WebView.

The goal of this stage is to unblock stage 2. When we proceed to stage 2, we will continue collecting data.

### Stage 2: Draft data format

**Goal date:** September 2024

The goal of this stage is to agree on how we will proceed with the data format.

An initial discovery phase will be initiated where we will review the data we have collected and confirm if we can reuse
any existing data formats or compatibility projects.

This stage may include drafting a new data format if we discover this is necessary. This does not need to be fully
concluded at this time.

At this time, all unstructured data will be converted into the agreed-upon draft data format.

### Stage 3: Agree on a stable version for data format and home

**Goal date:** February 2025

The goal of this stage is to produce the first stable version of the data format and move all structured data to a
more permanent location.
