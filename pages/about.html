		<h2>WebViews</h2>
		<p>A <b>native application</b> (or native app) is an application designed to run on a particular operating
			system.
			It is
			written in native code and leverages native APIs exposed by the operating system. Typical examples include
			an
			iOS
			application written in Swift or Objective-C and that uses the iOS SDK, or an Android application written in
			Kotlin, Java or C++ using
			the
			Android SDK. Native applications do not require a dedicated runtime to run as they interface with the
			operating system directly.</p>

		<p>A <b>web application</b> (or web app) is an application written using Web technologies (URLs, HTML, CSS,
			JavaScript APIs). Web applications typically run in a web browser runtime. All systems and devices that can
			render Web content have at least one <b>system-wide Web browser</b> application, which is either
			pre-installed
			on the device or that users can install.</p>

		<p><b>WebViews</b> are software components provided in an SDK that can be used to render Web content directly
			within a native application without having to switch to the system-wide Web browser. WebViews are
			used
			in a wide range of scenarios. They all share the same architecture: a native application embeds and
			interacts
			with one or more WebViews to render Web content within the WebView.</p>

			<h3>Types of WebViews</h3>
			<p>WebViews can differ based on the following properties:</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>UX flexibility</b>:
					Whether
					the native application has full control over the UX provided by the WebView or whether the
					WebView
					imposes
					the UX with limited customization and control from the native application.</li>
				<li><b>Access to the web content</b>: Whether
					the
					native application has the ability to read and modify the web content rendered in the WebView. The
					native
					application can leverage this to establish a communication link between the native code and the Web
					code, and
					in particular to expose native APIs to the Web content, making it possible for the Web content to
					make
					native
					calls.</li>
				<li><b>State sharing</b>: Whether the WebView shares state such as
					cookies and cache with the system-wide web browser, or is completely isolated.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>However, in practice, WebViews are classified into one of two categories with fixed properties:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><b>Browser-like</b> WebViews</dt>
				<dd>These WebViews are straightforward to embed with a simpler API surface mostly targeted at loading
					the
					web
					page. They are generally not flexible, do not provide access to the web content, but share
					state
					with the system-wide web browser.</dd>
				<dt><b>Fully-fledged</b> WebViews</dt>
				<dd>These WebViews are used for creating richer experiences and feature powerful integration primitives.
					They
					have full UX flexibility when integrated within an application, provide the ability to access the
					web
					content (native and web parts of the application can communicate), and do not share state with the
					system-wide web browser.</dd>
