		<h2>What is this all about?</h2>
		<p>CanIWebview is an initiative driven by the
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webview/">WebView CG</a>
			to make
			machine-readable compatability data on WebViews more readily available for documentation platforms and
			other tools. This app should help contributing this data and also help you test your web content in WebViews.

		<h2>BCD Collector</h2>

		<p>The browser-compat-data ("BCD") project contains machine-readable browser (and JavaScript runtime) compatibility data
		for Web technologies, such as Web APIs, JavaScript features, CSS properties and more. It's goal is to document accurate
		compatibility data for Web technologies, so web developers may write cross-browser compatible websites easier.</p>

		<p>
		You can use this app to run the <b><a
			href="https://mdn-bcd-collector.gooborg.com/">BCD collector</a></b> and help us collect data for CanIWebview and more sources.
