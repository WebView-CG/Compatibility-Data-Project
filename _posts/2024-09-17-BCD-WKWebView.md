We're happy to announce that our friends at [Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org) have now added WKWebView to the [browser compatibility data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data)!

This will now show up on the feature pages for iOS.

**If you want to help us out building this site or document compat data check out [this repository](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project).**
