We recently created our very own [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/webview-cg) to support the development of caniwebview.com and related ideas. In our last meetings we discussed the idea of creating open source testing apps for the major WebView APIs and platforms. With contributions to our collective we will be able to create these apps and put them in the app stores.

Stay tuned for new features and tools for caniwebview.
