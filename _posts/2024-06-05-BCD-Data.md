MDN has a really cool source of data called the [browser compatibility data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) that we are now pulling from!

It is still early days but this means we can now show data about other web features. BCD currently only has data for Android WebView but we plan to try support expanding this to other WebViews.

**If you want to help us out building this site or document compat data check out [this repository](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project).**
