We are now show [web features](https://caniwebview.com/search/?cat=web_feature) in the search results. In addition to this, we will also report if those features are [widely available in browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility), and if the same applies to WebViews.

This is only useful because of the work [Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org) has been doing to improve WebView support in [browser compatibility data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).

**If you want to help us out building this site or document compat data check out [this repository](https://github.com/WebView-CG/Compatibility-Data-Project).**
