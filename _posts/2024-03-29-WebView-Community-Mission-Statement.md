The WebView Compatibility Data Project is an initiative driven by the [WebView CG](https://www.w3.org/community/webview/)
to [make machine-readable data more readily available for documentation platforms and other tools
](https://github.com/WebView-CG/charter/blob/04422d7cb3ecc80a7d0f6755135995a74deab64b/charter.md?plain=1#L26).
