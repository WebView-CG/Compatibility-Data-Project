While building caniwebview.com, collecting data, testing and comparing features in different WebViews we noticed that having an Open Source reference apps for different platforms would benefit all developers that need to test something in WebViews. How WebViews behave and what they can do largely differs from platform to platform and these apps let us test how things work today.

We're excited to announce that the CanIWebView mobile apps are now available for download on both Android and iOS app stores! Therefore, we made the decision to build and publish apps under the CanIWebView brand. Stay tuned for more features and feel free to contribute.

The [Apps](/apps) page shows all current and future testing resources for WebViews.
